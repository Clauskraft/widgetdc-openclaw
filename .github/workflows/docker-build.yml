      # Build only (no push). If this fails, the PR breaks container builds.
      # Note: OPENCLAW_VERSION is intentionally NOT passed here. This exercises
      # the auto-detection path (GitHub API → git ls-remote → main fallback),
      # which is the same code path used by one-click Railway deployments.
      # Do NOT add an OPENCLAW_VERSION build-arg to CI — that would bypass the
      # detection logic and prevent us from catching regressions in it.
